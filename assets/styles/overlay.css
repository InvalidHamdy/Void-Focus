/* Maintained inside shadow DOM mostly, but this file is loaded via manifest as CSS file. 
   Usually better to inject styles into shadow DOM manually to ensure isolation, 
   which is done in blocker.js. 
   We can keep this for global resets if needed or remove it from manifest if unused.
   For now, I'll put a dummy comment.
